# BinaryTreeTestAndComparation

My First Kotlin Project for Fun and Learning, also open for comment ;)

This application is for comparation of search/contain in ArrayList<String>, BinaryTree<String> of 10 chars strings for up to 1 million elements
Search is through search list of up to 5000 Array elements all randomly choosed from generated ArrayList<String>
Result of BinaryTree search is unbelievable small in comparation with ArrayList.contain()! 10 - 400 times faster! It Killing!

Please be open to comment this app!
